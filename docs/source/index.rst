Welcome to STIMP's documentation!
===================================

The python repository ``STIMP`` (`GitHub repository <https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/STIMP>`_) implements the methods in the **STIMP** paper.
STIMP an advanced AI framework to impute and predict Chl_a across a broad spatiotemporal scale in coastal oceans. 
STIMP's results can be utilized to diagnose and analyze the ecosystem health of coastal oceans based on the remote sensing measurement.


In this tutorial website, we provide guidelines for using ``STIMP`` along with remote sensing Chl_a data analysis examples, including imputation and prediction.
The source code for building the website can be found at https://github.com/Ryanfzhang/STIMP-tutorials.
